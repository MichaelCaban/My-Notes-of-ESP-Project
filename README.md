I am a windows user so this will work best if you are on windows
First Step:
Download all the files from the link above and extract it to the desktop or some where easy to get access to.

Second Step:
Download this [Flash Download Tool](https://www.espressif.com/en/support/download/other-tools)

Third Step:
When finished downloading you will need to open it and start the prosses to install it to your Esp32 device





When making the Wifi Pennetration Tool i first had to install python from the internet


After installing python you go to the CMD you can do that by typing it in run which you right click the start key and right clicking it or you type it in the search bar on the taskbar
